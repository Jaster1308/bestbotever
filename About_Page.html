<h1>That is this thing?</h1>
<h2><span>This here under me is the link to a twitter bot that I created. It's not the greatest......
but hey, it works.........I wanted to make this twitter bot just to piss off mostly my friends and I wanted it

every 10 minutes.............. <a href= "https://twitter.com/HarukiBot_desu">Great.....</a> </span></h2>
